This is a weather app built using #reactjs . #CSS is incorporated into components rather than a separate file, for ease of reading and editing. It makes a fetch request to the Open Weather API, and changes the background color and weather icon according to data. Hot days are red cards, colder days are blue cards. 

It is not complete. It will likely be incorporated into another project.
